# To-predict-the-Car-ride-Fare-by-statistical-Data-Analysis
Statistical data analysis of Boston Car rides(of around a month) to predict the ride fare based on different parameters.

Taken a dataset from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices which has a rides data of around 1 month of Uber an Lyft.
Exploratory data analysis helped to know the data.Applying regression and hypothesis testing,helped to predict fare of the ride.In hypothesis 
testing,different parameters such as:type of the car model,distance of the ride and time of the ride were taken into consideration to analyse
whether fare is dependant on such parameters.Regrssion also helped to find the dependant variables to predict fare.
